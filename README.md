This thesis explores the application of Hybrid Intelligence (HI) principles in Project Management and Project Engineering systems. It proposes a novel approach utilizing a Hybrid Intelligence ontology to assess the level of HI integration within these systems. This assessment is achieved through a metric called "HI-ness," which evaluates the effectiveness of human-machine collaboration in achieving project goals.

Extension of high-level ontology already defined in [Hybrid Intelligence KE Repository](https://github.com/kmitd/HI-CommonKADS/tree/main)
